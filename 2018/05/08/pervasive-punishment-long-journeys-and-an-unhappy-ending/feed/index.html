					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating as ever, Fergus. I just hope there will more than two scenarios. Moreover, I hope probation developments will take place locally as well as globally in many different ways. As it happens now, there maybe some global trends, but there are also local developments that contradict some of these trends. See for instance developments in Czech Republic towards restorative justice. I am very keen to see the other options :) Good luck with your very useful project. Ioan]]></description>
