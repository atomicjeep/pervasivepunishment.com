					<description><![CDATA[Norm is our Corporate office and Pauline is most of us on the front lines. 

But, both sides are correct. It&#039;s a very complicated subject and answer. Supervision is not a product that brings in millions. Supervision is a bill of goods that will, hopefully, save the public millions by turning Clients away from a life of crime and drugs, and/or keep them out of prison. How accurately measurable is that  really?  Cost goes up as caseloads go down, so no one really wants that except the Officers. Drug Courts work, but they don&#039;t pay much which forces a caseload of 100, when it should really be 50 (moderate and high risk). All for now---Scott]]></description>
