					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating as ever, Fergus. I just hope there will more than two scenarios. Moreover, I hope probation developments will take place locally as well as globally in many different ways. As it happens now, there maybe some global trends, but there are also local developments that contradict some of these trends. See for instance developments in Czech Republic towards restorative justice. I am very keen to see the other options :) Good luck with your very useful project. Ioan]]></description>

				Comment on What is supervision for? Norm and Pauline disagree&#8230; by Scott				</title>

					<description><![CDATA[Norm is our Corporate office and Pauline is most of us on the front lines. 

But, both sides are correct. It&#039;s a very complicated subject and answer. Supervision is not a product that brings in millions. Supervision is a bill of goods that will, hopefully, save the public millions by turning Clients away from a life of crime and drugs, and/or keep them out of prison. How accurately measurable is that  really?  Cost goes up as caseloads go down, so no one really wants that except the Officers. Drug Courts work, but they don&#039;t pay much which forces a caseload of 100, when it should really be 50 (moderate and high risk). All for now---Scott]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As I was reading I thought back to my time as a volunteer manager, and had the same idea as Kirstin - that lots of small organisations struggle to keep their books, produce accounts, budget for funding bids, and so on. It&#039;s pretty common to have a glut of volunteers for some roles, and a dearth for others. It&#039;s also common that if someone comes along with particular skills, you can suddenly notice a role for them which wasn&#039;t obvious before - though it can be hard to integrate them quickly. I am sure there would be local organisations which could find a space for Joe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fergus, the section on Pauline&#039;s appraisal is disheartening and just plain wrong. It&#039;s good to see other &#039;characters&#039; in this scenario as we often do focus on the person who has offended. What&#039;s to happen to Joe? Pauline could connect him to a third sector organisation that needs his skills and allows him to find some friends in the process. 
By the way, I think this medium is a great way to illuminate the intricacies of the processes and relationships that take place in criminal justice scenarios in a way that traditional academic writing can leave out. Looking forward to reading the next installation!]]></description>
