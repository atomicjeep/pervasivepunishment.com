								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is World Social Work Day and the theme of the day is relationships…</p>
<p>In this piece of writing, I reflect on ways in which I might have deprived people of their dignity (despite my best intentions) when working as a criminal justice social worker in the East End of Glasgow in the 1990s. I might be exaggerating a little; I’m not sure I was <em>this</em> bad a social worker, but I think it represents some of what was and is problematic about the ways that professionalism and professional services are sometimes constructed &#8212; and, more specifically, about the ways I worked.  It was written a few years ago, in the context of my then membership  of the Poverty Truth Commission (<a href="https://www.faithincommunityscotland.org/poverty-truth-commission/">https://www.faithincommunityscotland.org/poverty-truth-commission/</a>), and was prompted by my engagements with the expertise and experience of the other commissioners.  The Commission&#8217;s motto and mantra is that &#8216;Nothing About Us Without Us is For Us&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Without you?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was all <em>about </em>you</p>
<p>Respect for persons</p>
<p>Human dignity and worth</p>
<p>Self-determination</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was taught to understand you</p>
<p>‘Poverty, Discrimination and Disadvantage’</p>
<p>‘People in Adversity’</p>
<p>That bus to Barrowfield</p>
<p>My mind was trained</p>
<p>To empathise and engage</p>
<p>Building trust and rapport</p>
<p>Assessing and planning</p>
<p>In partnership, of course</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Interventions:</p>
<p>Psychosocial?</p>
<p>Task or person-centred?</p>
<p>Cognitive and behavioural?</p>
<p>Individual, group and community?</p>
<p>Clients, targets, systems</p>
<p>‘Evidence-based’</p>
<p>Evaluating ‘effectiveness’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when we finally met</p>
<p>I tried hard to be <em>for </em>you</p>
<p>I applied my mind</p>
<p>Applied my skills</p>
<p>Counseled, motivated, advocated</p>
<p>Striving to change for the better</p>
<p>It, them or you</p>
<p>But not us</p>
<p>Not us</p>
<p>Us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then I drove home</p>
<p>In my bought-and-paid-for car</p>
<p>To my west end flat</p>
<p>My home improvements</p>
<p>My cookbooks and culture</p>
<p>My double income, no children</p>
<p>Mostly strife-less life</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day I drove east again</p>
<p>Full of &#8216;preliminary empathy&#8217;</p>
<p>Figuring out how exactly to</p>
<p>Social work you better</p>
<p>In partnership, of course</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You were allocated to me</p>
<p>Already a ‘case’; an orange folder</p>
<p>Bulging with your annotated problems</p>
<p>Already a case; pre-reported</p>
<p>Pre-constructed</p>
<p>In a pre-liminary way, of course</p>
<p>All subject to a negotiation</p>
<p>But one in which I wrote your story</p>
<p>Fabricating you</p>
<p>Under headings</p>
<p>Conforming to my structures</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My story that rendered you;</p>
<p>Stripping the layers back to a</p>
<p>Hollowed out skeleton</p>
<p>That could fit my small coffin-shaped box of tricks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was meant to be all <em>about </em>you</p>
<p>But most of you was missing</p>
<p>All the fleshiness</p>
<p>The strong sinews that held you together</p>
<p>And the mind making sense</p>
<p>Of the senselessness</p>
<p>It was meant to be <em>for </em>you</p>
<p>&#8216;Promoting social welfare&#8217;</p>
<p>But <strong><em>nothing about you without you </em><u>was </u><em>for you</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except in the rare moments when I saw you and knew you</p>
<p>And you saw me and knew me</p>
<p>And we made some sense together.Without</p>

<p>The most beautiful of these, without doubt, is Sandy Butler&#8217;s gorgeous film of the book launch, which includes footage of Jo Mango and Friends performing &#8216;Depth&#8217; from the System Hold EP, of Louis Abbott performing &#8216;Always A Way&#8217; from the Seen and Heard EP, of me reading from &#8216;An Invisible Collar&#8217;, and of various kind  audience members sharing what they made of it all. It&#8217;s only 5 minutes long, but the film does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of a very memorable evening. Click on the thumbnail about and see for yourself!</p>
<p>Back in November, Jo and I were also invited to talk about the book and the EP on BBC Radio Scotland&#8217;s &#8216;Sunday Morning with Richard Holloway&#8217; programme. The BBC have kindly allowed us to hold onto the audio, which you can find here:</p>

<p>And finally, I was also invited to write a short piece for the online magazine Discover Society. This was published in January. If text is your thing, then have a look here:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post again soon when there is more news about the release of Jo&#8217;s EP &#8216;System Hold&#8217; by Olive Grove Records. We&#8217;re expecting this to be in March.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post comes from Ewan Glassford, one of those currently studying Pervasive Punishment as an Honours course at the University of Glasgow. What follows is his response to the reflective essay challenge set out in an earlier post&#8230; Ewan refers to the song &#8216;Blankface&#8217; which I have discussed in even earlier posts and which can be heard here: <a href="https://voxliminis.bandcamp.com/track/blankface">Blankface</a>.  For ease of reference, here are the songs lyrics:</em></p>
<p>________</p>
<p><strong>Blankface</strong></p>
<p>The clock spins, zero hour begins</p>
<p>This is the end, the end again</p>
<p>Here sits blankface and she spins my tale</p>
<p>I’ve stopped listening now I know that I’ll fail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tick by tick and line by line</p>
<p>Thread by thread now you weave mine</p>
<p>A web of shadows, a silk spun tomb</p>
<p>A windowless room, windowless room</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sliding doors open and they welcome me in</p>
<p>This is the place where we pay for sin</p>
<p>These four seasons they reflect in glass</p>
<p>Trapped in a jar here where the time will not pass</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tick by tick and line by line</p>
<p>Thread by thread now you weave mine</p>
<p>A web of shadows, a silk spun tomb</p>
<p>A windowless room, windowless room</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day ending, a new day begins</p>
<p>Tick says ‘he’ll do it’, again and again</p>
<p>You see what you want but I know it’s not real</p>
<p>Anyone out there who can feel what I feel?</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>My eyes glossed furtively across the lyrics projected on the screen. “Blankface” was the title. Brilliant, I thought, as I anticipated a musical dissection of the impersonal and dehumanising nature of the lived experience of surveillance &#8211; one that could perhaps partially resonate with my own. However, only partially, as in my experience some of the supervising faces where anything but blank.</p>
<p><strong><u>Faces</u></strong></p>
<p>Some of my supervisor’s faces were friendly, with empathic eyes and toothy grins. Others where stern, their gaze reproachful, with lips that would chastise and belittle &#8211; not in what those lips said but in what they did not. Those were faces that never suggested understanding, acceptance or support, much less verbalize it. Though, yes, I thought, some faces where blank. One makes the optimistic assumption that the faces in front of these supervisory bodies were not born blank but made blank. Wiped clean by statistical data, performance reviews, standard procedures and a heavy caseload. However, this is an assumption that I have found myself questioning increasingly the more blank faces I’ve met. So it seems does the songwriter.</p>
<p>The music begins, the soft rhythmic melodies of the guitar are met with a forlorn and haunting voice and it becomes immediately clear what the emotional landscape of someone who has been met with the blank faces of penal supervision is. These are blank faces in a context I have never seen, representatives of a system I have never been through and emotions I could never hope to understand. The vocalist ends with his call for comprehension from others: “Anyone out there who can feel what I feel?” For my part, the answer is a resounding no. There are, however, certain parallels in my own lived experience of supervision.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Opening and Closing of Doors</u></strong></p>
<p>I too, like the songwriter, have at one point, been trapped in rooms. However, unlike the songwriter, the rooms I inhabited were not metaphorically speaking “windowless”. They had windows, but fewer doors. The doors that were there would not slide open &#8211; I would be met with those “welcoming” doors later &#8211; at that point, in those rooms, those doors here opened at others&#8217; discretion. Those tasked with my surveillance. Those who would take notes of my behaviour, my body and my thoughts. Those who were ostensibly there to facilitate a positive health outcome, but whose implicit motive was to foster compliance.</p>
<p>It is difficult at this point for me to discuss my experience of everyday supervision without reference to the more extensive level of supervision I experienced; one that goes beyond the everyday. How do I discuss my emotional reaction to the gaze of a CCTV camera without reference to of a place where the watchful eye of CCTV was all pervasive? Can I discuss my experience of being stewarded at a football game without mentioning that the sight of someone in fluorescent clothing provokes flashbacks to those uniforms in a more oppositional context? My experience of everyday surveillance is coloured by the past. Surveillance to me is not an abstract concept that lies dormant in the back of my mind waiting for reflective thought but a very real concrete expression of institutional power &#8211; power that every individual is subject to, albeit to varying extents. Some doors are shut more firmly than others.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Jar</u></strong></p>
<p>Again, the extent of my experience of surveillance is incomparable to that of the songwriter. However, we have a certain overlap of experience in that we have both been inhabitants of a total institution. We have both also experienced a re-entry into society outside the walls of those institutions. However, again, here we diverge. Under the everyday surveillance of my daily life I had to prove I could re-integrate; he had to prove he had reformed. The songwriter “pays” for his “sins”. It was his very soul that was the subject of analysis; his spirit that lay under the spotlight of his supervisors&#8217; gaze. Conversely, for my supervisors my body was the unit of analysis- with the Foucauldian medical gaze reducing my thoughts and actions to mere bio-chemical processes. It seems we both felt trapped in jars, like specimens encased in transparent glass, inspected by others outside that glass in a space much larger than we could comprehend.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Blankfaced Spider and the Web of Others&#8217; Stories</u></strong></p>
<p>The image of a “silk spun tomb” provided by the songwriter is evocative of a spider’s web. One in which the writer has been trapped. I ask myself what the web is made of, what makes it adhesive and what the chances of escape from its hold are. What are the webs formed by everyday surveillance?</p>
<p>Perhaps the web is formed of others&#8217; stories. Do supervisors in all contexts enforce their own stories on us? They certainly have artistic liberties with the adjectives used in describing our pasts, the nouns used to describe our present selves and the verbs that map out our futures. As the songwriter puts it, the “Blankface” he met would “spin” his “tale”, taking authorial control over the narrative of his life.</p>
<p>In governmental documentation both the songwriter and I would be categorised as “service users”, but in reality we were allocated more iconographic roles.  We were both typecast; I The Patient and he The Criminal. It seems that these were the roles that we were expected to play with the utmost sincerity. For my part, I would like to think I put on a performance convincing enough that Goffman himself would applaud. My supervisors wrote a story for me and I followed the script.</p>
<p>However, as per the penultimate line in the song &#8212; “You see what you want but I know it’s not real” &#8212; my interactions with the people tasked with surveying my lifestyle and behaviour were performative. What they wanted to see I showed them. I conformed to the character they had placed in their own story. More checkboxes ticked with “good” rather than “very bad”. More hours accounted for as productive in my weekly routine. Cognitions were challenged, Behaviour bettered and Thoughts tested. With each checkbox my supervisors ticked, my web grew a little less sticky, until I was no longer trapped by the stories they had spun.</p>
<p>I wonder what checkboxes the songwriter had to get his supervisors to tick in order to prove his compliance. What combination of restrictions &#8211; both explicit and implicit &#8211; gave the songwriter the impression that his own surveillance assumed the inevitability of recidivism? What the “it” of this breach of parole the songwriter refers to when he says “Tick says ‘he’ll do it’, again” does not seem important. Rather it is the artist’s keen perception of what the expectations &#8211; and subsequent management &#8211; of his criminal potentiality are.  Is it an electronic tag or unpaid work, perhaps even drug testing which are unbreakable contractual obligations of his engagement with probation services? I think of the vast gulf between the prescriptive behavioural patterns I was encouraged to take and the unavoidable stipulations of behavioural compliance for the songwriter.</p>
<p>Our stories are fundamentally different. I was cast as the protagonist, he the repentant villain. My web was a transitory home, his a trap. What would he have to do in order to escape from that web? What would he need to do to be given the freedom to write his own story?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guest post comes from Aniysa Ruhi, one of the students currently studying Pervasive Punishment at the University of Glasgow. It is her ingenious, evocative and creative response to the reflective essay task outlined in my previous post.</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>Gardening has become a hobby of mine. I planted lavender in the front garden beside my bedroom window, in the hopes that, when it gets bigger in the coming years, I would smell it on the summer breeze. Lavender is a dry plant, but I’ve seen them survive the Scottish downpour in other gardens. Plus, they are low maintenance since they can go without water in the summer months. I also planted a knee-high, evergreen fir tree out of nostalgia for the home I grew up in. That one had been much taller. On the last spare patch of soil, I took a chance on a bright pink rhododendron with 5 flowers and strong almost plastic green leaves. I knew nothing of the care for this plant but in the shop, it looked so vibrant that I felt the impulse to buy it.</p>
<p>I dug up all the weeds and thought about soil. I’m usually scared of worms and bugs, but that May I didn’t think much of them, they were where they belonged, and a necessary part of the ecosystem. I accepted these facts as they were, and it became easy. I felt brave in a small way for overcoming my old fears, especially given that I was discovering new ones in adulthood.</p>
<p>I tried to pull up the weeds by the roots, but they had been left for too long, and I didn’t have the arm strength. Inevitably some got away, deep in the earth, soon to surface again. It wasn’t a perfect environment to grow, but it was what I could manage and afford at the time.</p>
<p>Our front garden had the worse reputation among the neighbours. As I weeded away, they stopped in the middle of the street to give me advice, folded arms leaning on the fence. Some offered seeds for herbs, others volunteered gardening equipment. I politely declined their help, and felt slightly irritated by their comments, ‘finally,’ ‘good for you,’ ‘I was going to do something about it if you didn’t.’ ‘…far too overgrown.’ ‘someone had to take care of this mess.’</p>
<p>I planted the rhododendron last. I gave them all plenty of water to survive the summer and weeded the garden every month or so. Whenever I had water in my backpack after coming home from work I would empty it onto the plants, if I remembered. As I supervised the growth of my garden, I realised it was also a reflection of care and commitment invested in my home. I planted them expecting these plants to grow in the coming years, with longevity in mind.</p>
<p>I felt fixed in place. Our flat belongs to my parents, and they plan to stay here indefinitely. For the foreseeable future, this garden was my sole responsibility, an inheritance of sorts. Still, no one allocated me this role, I volunteered out of personal interest and concern. I thought myself capable of gardening.</p>
<p>The summer passed, I felt pride every time I saw my garden. The weeds were persistent, but from the deep-rooted system I had started with, they were expected. I didn’t want to use any sort of weed killer in case the soil became toxic and barren, it was natural for some weeds to grow. Still, they couldn’t grow so tall as to block the sunlight or sap the nutrients of the plants. I always weeded by hand, careful not to cause lasting damage.</p>
<p>As autumn approached, the fir tree stayed as vibrant as it did in the summer, the lavender, dulled in colour and the rhododendron stayed in bloom before wilting, leaves and all, in late November. I had a different set of expectations for each plant, and the slow, natural changes or resistance in them felt assuring to watch. Classes started up again, I didn’t have much time to garden, nor the tolerance for the sharp cold, but the weeds also grew back slower in winter.</p>
<p>The first day of snow that year, I frantically googled ways to guard my plants from the blizzards to come. I hadn’t even thought of the effects of the cold, until I saw the highly visible white piles of snow weighing down the leaves. Balancing in high piles on the smallest perches.</p>
<p>In fact, I barely considered that something as routine as winter could be harmful. I wore thick jumpers, bought new boots and even called the snow beautiful, watching from behind a glass pane. Not until I saw the snow have a visible, weighted impact on the exposed plants did I think of the consequences. Didn’t it snow everywhere sometimes? When it happened under my watch I was somehow responsible. It was so easy to plant in the spring, when the idea felt full of potential. Even when I did remember the snow, there wasn’t much I could do at this point.</p>
<p>A small crisis- what if they died in the winter? I couldn’t control the cold. The only consoling thought I had was that at this point, it was out of my hands, they were already invested this far into the year, and if they didn’t survive, I would have to start all over again, and use the failure as a learning experience.</p>
<p>Or give up all together. Abandon the concept of a growing, living, place that I helped to build. Cover up the garden with woodchips. Conclude that the soil was difficult to grow on anyway, and that the whole endeavour had been a poorly thought out experiment.</p>
<p>As It turns out, the best thing to do was let them be. Snow has an insulating property, and its best to leave the layer, as opposed to disrupting it. This was a natural process after all, contained in my garden but still connected to soil and sunlight, like anywhere else. I let the months thaw into spring. Sometimes it just takes time. Admittedly, I overreacted.</p>
<p>Spring came again, I felt somewhat disheartened to garden, but the evergreen tree thrived on, taller now, a symbol of success. Even in the snow, it looked positively festive. I had planted it there knowing it was at a low risk of wilting. But this couldn’t be carried through to the other plants, they were fundamentally different, despite the common soil. They had different needs, they didn’t simply adapt anywhere, they were still unpredictable. It was clear they needed more attention, especially the rhododendron.</p>
<p>I learned too late, when the new leaves were coming in, that it required pruning in early spring. A whole new concept that I couldn’t really wrap my head round. By cutting away the branches they grow back bigger? Seemed counter intuitive. Last year’s dead leaves still hung limply and would hinder any new growth. This summer, only one flower blossomed on the bush. I was just happy it survived the freezing winter.</p>
<p>I like to think that the act of gardening as mutually beneficial, especially when I see tiny birds rest in the shade of the fir tree, but I can only speak for my experience as a gardener. It’s important to me to watch something change and grow. It helps me think in terms of slow change and the gradual process of growth. Only after a series of exacted, continuous acts does change occur. Naturally, like rain or curated, like a watering can. The result is the same in the end. By the time anyone else notices, it’s a serendipitous bloom- I like to remember the hard work and winters endured. It’s not a linear process. There’s a whole world I can’t see beneath the earth. I work with what I can see. Uprooting everything just to satisfy my curiosity would be fundamentally destructive, and selfish of me.</p>
<p>Maybe my care is an intrusion against some natural order. Maybe my plants don’t even belong in a garden and should have stayed potted for longer. Even so, I like to believe that in the long term the branches might grow even taller than me one day. They will be so strong, I won’t think twice about their health. Though for now, in these early days, I choose what to bloom.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last 7 weeks, since the start of this semester, I&#8217;ve been teaching a Sociology Honours class based on the book. We&#8217;re not quite finished yet (it&#8217;s a 10 week, 20 credit course), but reading some of the students&#8217; initial work has inspired to write a little about the process now.</p>
<p>Given that the book contains the short story (&#8216;An Invisible Collar&#8217;), uses pictures from the <a href="http://www.offendersupervision.eu/supervisible">Supervisible and Picturing Probation</a> projects and the songs from the  <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://voxliminis.bandcamp.com/album/seen-and-heard-ep">Seen and Heard</a> EP, and relates the development of Jo Mango&#8217;s new &#8216;System Hold&#8217; EP,  it has been possible &#8212; indeed necessary &#8212; to integrate all of these materials in the teaching and learning.  In a sense, teaching the class has given me the chance to test some of the book&#8217;s arguments (in chapter 6) about how creative methods and outputs might stimulate a deeper dialogue about supervision as a largely invisible and unimaginable form of punishment.</p>
<p>As a mid-term assignment, I asked the students to write a reflective essay. I&#8217;m going to copy and paste below some of the guidance that I gave them, and then over the next few days, with their permission, I&#8217;m going to share a few examples of the excellent work that the students produced. I&#8217;ll leave it to you to judge whether this all &#8216;worked&#8217;&#8211; and, if you are an educator &#8212; whether you might want to try something similar?  Maybe if you are teaching a class for which the book is relevant, you could adapt my approach and use the materials? If you do, all I ask is that you let me know how it goes&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the student guidance:</p>
<p><strong>Pervasive Punishment: Reflective writing assignment </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>reflective writing assignment </strong>is an essay of 1,000-1,500 words, due <strong>22/18/18, 3pm</strong>. This accounts for 30% of your mark for the course.</p>
<p>This short piece of <strong>reflective writing</strong> is to be based on engaging with creative representations of supervision in the forms of photographs and/or songs and/or stories. You can choose which and how many of these materials to engage with. You might choose to focus on just one picture or one song or one episode of the story, or you might span all the representations (i.e. 10 pictures, 8 songs and 8 episodes) in all three media.</p>
<p><strong>No reading and no referencing is required for this task.</strong> The focus is on r<strong>eflecting (looking back at) experience</strong>. The task involves making reflective connections between 2 experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>The experience of engaging with the pictures and/or songs and/or story</li>
<li>Your own experience of being supervised by or supervising someone. [There is absolutely no need to think about a difficult experience; indeed, the focus is supposed to be on the everyday, the banal, the ordinary.]</li>
</ol>
<p>Reflective writing should focus on affect, emotion, atmosphere, feelings and thoughts. The emphasis is not so much on the <em>action</em>(the picture, song, story) as on your <em>reaction</em>. Hence, you don’t need to discuss the nature or detail of your own experience (indeed, there isn’t enough space to do that). Rather, you should write about your reactions to the pictures/songs/stories <em>in the light of </em>your experiences, looking for resonances and dissonances: what do you and don’t you relate to?</p>
<p>The key question you are trying to address in the task is this:</p>
<p><strong>How and to what extent did engaging with these pictures/songs/this story, in light of your own life experience, affect your understanding of what it might be like to be a subject of (penal) supervision?</strong></p>
<p>You might also think about what these representations have highlighted and what might they have concealed or failed to reflect?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty quiet on this blog since submitting the book manuscript back in June&#8230; catching my breath and preparing to resume normal duties mostly.</p>
<p>The good news is that the book is now up on the publisher&#8217;s catalogue and can even be pre-ordered!  See:  <a href="https://books.emeraldinsight.com/page/detail/Pervasive-Punishment/?K=9781787564664">Pervasive Punishment</a></p>
<p>In other exciting news, I&#8217;ve commissioned the wonderful Gabi Froden to come up with cover art for the EP of 4 songs that the equally wonderful Jo Mango (a.k.a. Jo Collinson Scott) is currently finishing off.  We&#8217;re hoping that the cover art will work for the book too.</p>
<p>One novel feature of the book is a Post-Script about the writing of the short story (now called &#8216;The Invisible Collar&#8217;) and the making of the EP.  I can honestly say it&#8217;s one of the best bits of the book&#8230; really because Jo wrote most of it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working today on a report (for the fellowship&#8217;s funder, the British Academy)  on all of the project&#8217;s activities and outputs, as one must. One useful aspect of this has been the need to write a 500 word summary of the book. So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the book which is the main output of this project, I argue that ‘mass supervision’ is a largely invisible form of punishment. This invisibility limits our ability to imagine what supervision entails and so we are poorly placed to debate its legitimacy and effectiveness as a way of delivering justice.</p>
<p>‘Mass supervision’ has many dimensions. The book focuses on its scale and social distribution, how it has been legitimated, and how it is experienced.</p>
<p>An analysis of data and scholarship from the USA and Scotland reveals that in both countries there have been huge increases in the scale of supervision but that supervision is concentrated within disadvantaged communities. Explaining these developments requires close examination of distal, proximate and local influences on how criminal justice is contested and configured.</p>
<p>To explore the contestation of supervision and how it has been legitimated, I provide a close reading of the development of probation in Scotland. Here, a commitment to reducing imprisonment has been discursively interwoven with rehabilitation, reparation and managerialism at different times in the history of supervision. But I argue that the Scottish case is a salutary tale of successful failure; producing a huge expansion in rates of supervision but having little impact on imprisonment rates. More generally, making sense of Scotland’s enduring but flawed and fragile welfarism requires analysis of the contestation of criminal justice ‘all the way down’ to the levels of practice and experience. Only here can we understand what punishment is, what it means and how it is changing. This is as true of supervision as it is of imprisonment.</p>
<p>To examine supervision as a lived experience, I focus on findings from two creative projects – <em>Supervisible </em>and <em>Seen and Heard </em>– that explored how supervisees chose to represent their experiences of supervision in pictures and in songs. These findings have much in common with a wider range of recent ethnographies of supervision. Taken together, these studies draw attention to the pervasiveness and painfulness of supervision as a lived experience, even if some studies also suggest that these pains may be moderated if supervision is experienced as legitimate, helpful and time-limited. Absent these three conditions, mass supervision develops ‘maloptical’ qualities, representing a form of pervasive penal control that disperses degradation and disqualification as much as discipline, diminishing its subjects’ civic standing and rights, and thus the state’s responsibilities to and liabilities for them.</p>
<p>Having developed this analysis, in the book’s final two chapters, I explore what can be done to restrain mass supervision, firstly by making it visible and imaginable so as to enable political dialogue about it. In the last chapter, I conclude by suggesting that any project of challenging mass supervision requires at least three inter-related strategies: the first focused on scaling down supervision, the second focused on clarifying and circumscribing its legitimate purposes and role, and the third (within these constraints) focused on developing and delivering it constructively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simple. Or not.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time last week I was ensconced in a lovely house in the beautiful Fife village of Anstruther (thanks Heather!), assembling the book chapters into something like a complete manuscript, which now stands at about 72,000 words. Aside from trying to iron out stylistic variations between the chapters and some changes of tone, and responding to helpful comments from my loyal band of reviewers, I was also doing the tiresome work of chasing down references and seeking permission to use previously published sources, figures and text.</p>
<p>It was a real delight to have the luxury of complete focus on these tasks, away from all the distractions of home and work, and to enjoy a few days of isolation as I tried to put the book to bed, as it were.  I&#8217;m really going to miss that sort of time and space when I return to a more conventional academic workload next session.</p>
<p>Reviewing the conclusion of the book also allowed me time and space to think and write about the possible futures of &#8216;mass supervision&#8217;, as imagined in the two endings of the short story (now titled &#8216;Left Hanging&#8217;) published on this blog previously. The final chapter begins with the more dystopian ending, and then develops an argument for the kinds of principles and commitments that we need to hold on to if we are to avoid it. I ended the book, very deliberately, with the more positive ending to the story, trying to hint at what Roberto Unger calls &#8216;the adjacent possible&#8217;. I came across Unger&#8217;s work by reading recent papers by Ian Loader and Richard Sparks, developing their ideas around criminology&#8217;s role in democratic dialogue about crime and punishment. In particular, this quotation made a big impression on me as I neared the end of writing Pervasive Punishment:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I propose something distant, you may say: interesting, but Utopian. If I propose something close, you may answer: feasible but trivial. In contemporary efforts to think and talk programmatically, all proposals are made to seem either Utopian or trivial. We have lost confidence in our ability to imagine structural change in society, and fall back upon a surrogate standard: a proposal is realistic if it approaches what already exists. It is easy to be a realist if you accept everything.&#8221; (Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Democracy Realized, 1998: 36)</p>
<p>Those seem to me to be both important and troubling words for social scientists. If, as Loader and Sparks put it, we are to move &#8216;beyond lamentation&#8217;, beyond &#8216;mere&#8217; critique, we need to be able to imagine and offer alternatives. For me, this is perhaps where social science has most to gain from engaging with the Arts and Humanities. My friend Padraig O&#8217;Tuama (a poet, theologian and peace-maker) posted this Emily Dickinson poem recently on Instagram:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Possible&#8217;s slow fuse is lit,</p>
<p>By the imagination.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Emily Dickinson, 1687.J [unknown date])</p>
<p>I tend to read those words positively, but of course we live in a world where dark imaginings all too often find themselves realised. That&#8217;s why we need a constant dialogue between theory, research and practice; between art and science; between law and liberty.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I am really delighted to report that the wider Pervasive Punishment project is not quite finished yet. A month or two ago, I began talking to Jo Collinson Scott (musician, songwriter [as Jo Mango] and musicologist) about whether she might make some songs somehow inspired by or in dialogue with the short story and/or with the book in general. She very kindly agreed and has been working with the musician-producer Adem to produce an EP of 4 songs. Other collaborators in this musical off-shoot include A. Wesley Cheung, Lucy Cathcart Froden (a.k.a. Raukarna) and Martin Cathcart Froden. I&#8217;m very eager to see what they  produce, but knowing them and their work, I have no doubt at all that it will provide &#8212; at the very least &#8212; another angle of inflection upon and another way of engaging with &#8216;mass supervision&#8217;. I hope all these imaginings will light a fuse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t want to leave you for long with just the unhappy ending offered in the last post. So, here again is the plot summary, and then the happier ending&#8230;</p>
<p>Joe has been placed on supervision (involving probation and electronic monitoring). Pauline is his supervisor. She is a somewhat battle-weary social worker, struggling to hold on to her values and her enthusiasm in the face of a high caseload and the onslaught of managerialism. Norm is her modernising supervisor, who genuinely believes in chasing the Key Performance Indicators as a way of efficiently serving the public interest. In the penultimate episode, Joe had visited a group convened by Petra called the Conviction Collective, made up of people that have experience of criminal justice and want to work to support one another and reform the system. Pauline had thought that Joe might find some purpose and some support there &#8212; and indeed, his first encounter with the group had awoken something in him.</p>
<p>12 months have passed since that hopeful moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>VII-b    The gang of four</em></p>
<p><em>Norm heard two sounds as he woke: his own low moan and the insistent, monotonous electronic bell tolling from his alarm clock. It read 08.01 – he had 59 minutes to get ready and catch that train. Today was the day of the Justice Committee hearing on the future of supervision.</em></p>
<p><em>Norm hadn’t slept well, though already he couldn’t quite recollect the plots and sub-plots of the anxiety dreams that had plagued him in the night. Did Joe bring a tin of red paint to the hearing in one version? Did Petra accuse the parliamentarians of ‘techno-fascism’ in another? He was sure Pauline had been late in every version.</em></p>
<p><em>The old Norm would have run for cover by now but, despite his fears, the new Norm was excited about the day ahead. There was no doubt that the past 12 months had changed him. As he looked in the mirror, tying his tie, he admitted that he liked what he was becoming better than what he had been. </em></p>
<p><em>His first encounter with the Conviction Collective – at Pauline’s insistence – had left him unconvinced. Initially, he was sceptical about the willingness and ability of people under supervision to provide meaningful and effective peer support. But, he reasoned that if the Collective was a free supplement to formal services, then why not give it a chance? To offset any risk to his personal reputation and standing in the Company, Norm made clear that it was Pauline’s initiative and Pauline’s responsibility. </em></p>
<p><em>Within weeks though, seeing the glint in her eye and the spring in her step, he decided he should attend the weekly gathering and see what was going on. At first the answer seemed to be: ‘Not much’. About 12-15 people met and shared some pizza (it was never clear who paid for it, but Norm suspected Pauline). They talked together, sometimes they walked together; someone found an old table tennis table. </em></p>
<p><em>But, they also got organised. Ever the accountant, Joe had been instrumental in persuading them to identify, recognise and detail all the forms of ‘capital’ that they held. He made an inventory of their skills, resources and contacts. They started to simply exchange goods and services and introductions for one another; from each according to ability, to each according to need. The group grew and so did the inventory. The founding members invested more of themselves, the new members brought new assets and abilities. They advised, assisted and befriended one another.</em></p>
<p><em>Group members also began to share more and more of their experiences – both better and worse – of the justice system. The invited other ‘expert witnesses’ to plug the gaps in their understanding; criminologists, lawyers, sociologists – even a historian. Norm himself had been invited to explain the logic of the current supervision system. That had been quite a challenge and quite a grilling. Soon, the Collective had written a manifesto, naming it: ‘Just Conviction, Fair Supervision’. Norm didn’t agree with all its proscriptions and prescriptions, but he admired its clarity, its use of evidence and the force of its arguments. </em></p>
<p><em>The press soon took an interest. Petra turned out to be quite an operator; proving more than adept at handling everything from hostile questions from cynical political hacks to irate callers on early morning phone-ins. Surprisingly perhaps, listening to Petra and the others, people seemed to become more cautious and more curious about what sentences did to people and about what they achieved or failed to achieve for society. </em></p>
<p><em>Initially, Norm’s bosses had liked the positive PR that supporting the Collective generated; they thought it made them look progressive. They hadn’t been so happy about ‘Just Conviction, Fair Supervision’ – worried about their market share, he supposed, if those proposals were ever to be implemented. That said, Norm and Joe didn’t have to work too hard to convince the Company that excessive supervision wasn’t especially lucrative; not at least while there were stubbornly high revocation and reconviction rates. The Company knew that re-nationalisation was back on the political agenda; it was time to look for better business opportunities elsewhere. At the very least, Joe had argued, working with the government and the courts to scale down supervision and to deliver better results might minimise losses in the meantime. And in reputational terms, it also meant that the Company wasn’t left carrying the can on its own.</em></p>
<p><em>It was now Norm’s job to lead the Ministry-sanctioned local pilot of ‘Just Conviction, Fair Supervision’. And it was the very early results of the pilot that had led to the invitation to Norm, Petra, Pauline and Jo to give evidence to the Committee today.</em></p>
<p><em>The gang of four met at the coffee stall in the train station. Even Pauline was on time. They greeted one another like old friends, collected their orders and, as was their habit, made for the front carriage. They knew they were going to be in a hurry at their destination. They had already come a long way together in a short time, but there was a lot of work still to be done.  </em></p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Again, let me know your thoughts, please? Is this just too hopeful to ring true?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of travelling to the University of Chicago, the University of Minnesota and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice (in New York) to talk about Pervasive Punishment. One of the lovely things about the Mid-Career Fellowship is that it provides some funds to allow me to &#8216;road-test&#8217; the book. I&#8217;ll be making another trip to Brussels and Leiden in early June to do the same with some key European colleagues. I&#8217;ve chosen to visit these five cities because of the many wonderful colleagues in each place doing important work on &#8216;mass supervision&#8217; or in adjacent fields. I&#8217;ll perhaps post again in a few days to try to summarise some of what I learned along the way but, in broad terms, the trip to the USA was very encouraging. People really seemed to respond well both to the arguments I&#8217;m developing in the book and to the unusual; mix of methods through which I&#8217;m trying to present them.</p>
<p>Along the way, I did some serious thinking about chapter 7: the final chapter of the book. In it, I plan to offer two possible futures for supervision: The chapter&#8217;s main sub-headings are &#8216;supervision unleashed&#8217; and &#8216;supervision restrained&#8217;. Each of them will feature a different ending to the short story that runs through the book. As with previous episodes, I wanted to get some feedback on how the story might end in each case; as you&#8217;ll have guessed, one ending will be dystopian, the other will be (practically!) utopian.  To sum up the story so far, Joe has been placed on supervision (involving probation and electronic monitoring). Pauline is his supervisor. She is a somewhat battle-weary social worker, struggling to hold on to her values and her enthusiasm in the face of a high caseload and the onslaught of managerialism. Norm is her modernising supervisor, who genuinely believes in chasing the Key Performance Indicators as a way of efficiently serving the public interest. In the penultimate episode, Joe had visited a group called the Conviction Collective, made up of people that have experience of criminal justice and want to work to support one another and reform the system. Pauline had thought that Joe might find some purpose and some support there &#8212; and indeed, his first encounter with the group had awoken something in him.</p>
<p>12 months have passed since that hopeful moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>VII-a    Administering shocks and sickness</em></p>
<p><em>Joe heard two sounds as he woke: his own low moan and the insistent, monotonous electronic bell tolling from his ankle bracelet. He fumbled for the clock—it read 08.01 – he had 59 minutes to get to the probation office for his check-in. He knew that somewhere, somehow, some algorithm had determined that this was the moment to test his commitment, to strengthen his resolve, to keep him from temptation. At least that was how Norm had explained it, but Joe saw that the bracelet-bell was a call to worship, an invitation to obey, a hell-fire warning to the walking dead. He pressed the button to acknowledge the signal and the bell stopped.</em></p>
<p><em>Joe washed and dressed cautiously, taking care not to let his sock break the contact between bracelet and skin. He knew that any interruption in the signal that allowed remote analysis of his pulse and sweat could constitute an infraction. He had no wish to repeat his recent experience of a weekend in the compliance cells as part of the new SaCS (Swift and Certain Sanction) approach. That had been a high price to pay for trying to use ice cubes and hypoallergenic wipes to relieve the skin irritation that the bracelet caused. </em></p>
<p><em>Forty minutes later, Joe was glad to find a reporting booth empty at the probation office. It looked like a cross between an arcade game, a confession and an upright coffin. He took a deep breath and sat inside, pulling the black curtain across. The touchscreen invited him to provide his hand-print while the retinal scan double checked and confirmed his identity. When prompted, Joe put on the virtual reality headset and was met by the smiling face of ‘Virpro’, the virtual probation officer. She spoke in slow, soft, maternal tones: </em></p>
<p><em>“Good morning, Joe. Well done. You have arrived on time and drug- and alcohol-free. We have no record of adverse contact with the authorities since your last appointment. There are 5 months and 2 weeks of your revised order remaining to be served. The conditions remain the same. Would you like me to remind you of them?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, thank you”, Joe replied. </em></p>
<p><em>“That is your choice. Do you require any support or counselling at this time?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, thank you”, Joe replied. He guessed he should probably show willing but couldn’t get out of the booth quickly enough. He felt suffocated.</em></p>
<p><em>“That is your choice. Please wait for a message from future Joe, after which you are free to go.” </em></p>
<p><em>This part always freaked Joe out. Virpro smiled her farewell and faded from view; in her place came an avatar of Joe, looking a few years older but well-groomed, confident, contented, suited and booted. His ‘brief motivational intervention’ was becoming as predictable as it was sinister:</em></p>
<p><em>“Hi Joe. I’m proud of you. You’ve done really well since that last infraction. The Swift and Certain Sanction really seems to have worked for you. You’re back on track, pal. And there are only a few months to go until you are a free man. Just keep at it. Keep your head down. Keep away from troublemakers”. </em></p>
<p><em>Future Joe paused for effect, losing his saccharine smile and replacing it with the furrowed brow of his most earnest expression. Though his intense stare met Joe’s eyes, it also seemed to look right through him, somewhere into the middle distance. </em></p>
<p><em>“Joe: Remember, you can become me, if you want it enough, if you really commit. I can be your future. Meantime, take care and look after us both”. </em></p>
<p><em>Outside, Joe steadied himself on the railing, taking in as much air as he could. As he walked away, he wondered what Pauline was doing now. He hadn’t expected to miss her this much.</em><em> </em></p>
<p><em>…</em></p>
<p><em>Upstairs, Norm looked at the three huge screens in front of him: 59’s green flag caught his eye. One of Pauline’s cases, he recalled. He had to admit that he kind of missed the lifers; the office was very quiet without them. </em></p>
<p><em>Still, Norm took some pride in that fact that he was now managing 412 low-medium risk cases himself; or rather, he was maintaining and monitoring the system that was managing them. It was remarkably efficient now that it was up and running, even if it would take 25 years (with caseloads at current levels) to recoup the installation costs. In the long run, it was worth it. Now that the infrastructure existed, the possibilities of combining remote biometric monitoring with VR and AI really were limitless. </em></p>
<p><em>That said, Norm still harboured some doubts. The new GATE (Geo-Aversion Tag Enhancer) tech troubled him. These tags could respond to remote signals to release nausea-inducing drugs implanted in pellets under the skin. In an emergency, the could issue taser-style shocks. Both measures trained and disabled offenders who strayed beyond their permitted spaces, or showed the classic signs of over-stimulation associated with imminent risk of offending.</em></p>
<p><em>Norm had a lot of sympathy for the argument that GATE allowed high risk offenders to be managed safely in the community. As the marketing slogan said: ‘GATE: It trains and restrains’. The pilot studies seemed promising, in spite of one or two admittedly very unfortunate cases. Yet, even if the offenders had to consent to GATE to avoid imprisonment, and even if they signed the disclaimers, he didn’t much like the idea that <strong>he</strong>was administering shocks and causing sickness, or even administering a system that did so. </em></p>
<p><em>Still, he thought it was probably better to keep his doubts to himself. This wasn’t punishment after all; it was just supervision for public safety.</em></p>

<p>As usual, please let me know your thoughts. And fear not, an alternative ending is coming soon!</p>
