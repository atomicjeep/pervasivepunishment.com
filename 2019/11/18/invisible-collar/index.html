<strong>The Invisible Collar: A story about supervision</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Fergus McNeill</em>
</p>
<p>
I           Waiting
</p>
<p>
Joe sat on the bench in the waiting room. Looking down, he noticed that the bench was screwed to the floor. Not even the furniture here was free. Perspex screens and locked doors separated him and the others waiting from those for whom they waited; the veils between the untrustworthy and those to whom they were entrusted. Joe absent-mindedly read the graffiti carved into the bench; testimonies of resistance that made the place feel even more desperate. 
</p>
<p>
Joe scanned the postered walls, shouting their messages in pastel shades and bold print. Problems with drugs? Problems with alcohol? Problems with anger? Stay calm. Apparently, help was at hand – or at the end of a phone-line. But meanwhile remember that abusive language and aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated. Not in this room that itself felt like an installation of abuse and aggression. To Joe it said: ‘You are pathetic, desperate or dangerous. You are not to be trusted. You must wait’.
</p>
<p>
He fidgeted and returned his eyes to the floor, downcast by the weight of the room’s assault, avoiding contact, avoiding hassle, staying as unknown as possible in this shame pit. Better to be out of place here than to belong. This was no place to make connections. 
</p>
<p>
Joe wondered what she would be like – Pauline -- the unknown woman who now held the keys to his freedom. Her word had become his law: This was an ‘order’ after all. He was to be the rule-keeper, she the ruler – cruel, capricious or kind. She might hold the leash lightly or she might drag him to heel. Instinctively, he lifted his hand to his neck, but no one can loosen an invisible collar. At least it was not a noose. Joe swallowed uncomfortably, noticing the dryness of his mouth and the churning in his gut. He was not condemned to hang. He was condemned to be left hanging. 
</p>
<p>
Joe wondered what Pauline would be like.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
II          Screen-weary eyes 
</p>
<p>
Pauline put down the phone. The new guy, the 59<sup>th</sup> on her caseload,<em> </em>was 15 minutes early. A sign of eagerness maybe, but also an irritation. She had too many other things to do and hadn’t had time to prep yet. She took off her glasses, rubbed her screen-weary eyes and gulped another mouthful of her now-cold coffee (black, of course; no one in the office brought in milk any more). Replacing her glasses in the twin dents on the bridge of her nose, she resumed her screen gaze, clicking the ‘casefiles’ icon and opening up no. 59 for the first time. 
</p>
<p>
Joseph Earnshaw, aged 49. Divorced father of 2. Two previous convictions – possession of cannabis and public affray… but these dated from almost 30 years ago. The indiscretions of his youth perhaps? The standard format court report was light on detail and substance, but the account of his offence was interesting. 
</p>
<p>
Having been made redundant two weeks before the incident, Earnshaw had returned to the offices of the accountancy firm where he had worked for 15 years. He was drunk and abusive, and proceeded to spray piss around the reception area before daubing the boss’s office door with the one-word epithet: ‘BLOODSUCKER’. The red paint had also found its way all over his former boss’s designer suit in the scuffle that ensued. 
</p>
<p>
The report said that Earnshaw scored ‘low-risk’ on the Offender Assessment Triage System (OATS). Pauline raised a single eyebrow; she was long enough in the tooth to be wary of that. She knew that these scores didn’t save probation officers from shouldering the blame when things went wrong. Funny how the scoring system itself could never be at fault. 
</p>
<p>
Joseph Earnshaw was either a bad case of an embarrassing and brief mid-life crisis or a man on the edge of a potentially violent meltdown who might lose Pauline her job. Maybe the court expected her to figure out which during the next 18 months.
</p>
<p>
Pauline sighed. When she had started out back in the 90s, she might have had the energy and enthusiasm – and the time – to suss him out and maybe even to help him get his head back together and his life on track. But caseloads back then were in the 20s or 30s not the 50s or 60s, and the bosses cared about and supported that sort of work. Now they cared only about targets. 
</p>
<p>
She cast her eyes across to Norm’s ‘pod’, wondering if her supervisor was even now watching her screen on his, or analyzing the IT system’s reports of the time she had spent in each of her casefiles in the last month. Glancing at her watch, she realized that she was probably already a quarter way through the monthly time allowance for a ‘low-risk’ case. She’d better go and see the guy before his time was up. 
</p>
<p>
She just hoped he wasn’t going to be a pain in the arse. She had enough of those to deal with already, with Norm top of the list.
</p>
<p>
  
</p>
<p>
III         Pragmatists not puritans
</p>
<p>
Norman stopped the video clip and lent back in his chair, stretching his back and trying to unfurrow his brow. He clicked open Pauline’s quarterly appraisal form, took a deep breath and contemplated the section of the pro-forma entitled ‘Video Practice Quality Audit’.
</p>
<p>
“1. <strong>Relational Skills</strong> (To what extent does the worker demonstrate an ability to develop a strong and appropriate professional working relationship with the offender?)[Rate on a 5-point scale, where 5 is ‘fully demonstrated’ and 1 is ‘not demonstrated’ at all].
</p>
<p>
2. <strong>Structuring Skills</strong> (To what extent does the worker keep the interview focused on addressing needs and risks related to reducing reoffending, using appropriate techniques to motivate, rehearse and reinforce prosocial behaviours and to challenge antisocial behaviours?) [Rate on a 5-point scale, where 5 is ‘fully focused’ and 1 is ‘not focused’ at all].
</p>
<p>
3. <strong>Use of authority</strong> (To what extent does the worker maintain appropriate professional boundaries using their authority to promote and enforce compliance with supervision?). [Rate on a 5-point scale, where 5 is ‘fully maintained’ and 1 is ‘not maintained’ at all].
</p>
<p>
4. <strong>Brokerage</strong> (To what extent does the worker ensure that the offender is appropriately signposted to relevant services relevant to addressing needs and risks?). [Rate on a 5-point scale, where 5 is ‘fully ensured’ and 1 is ‘not ensured’ at all].”
</p>
<p>
Norman sighed. Pauline’s performance in 59’s induction interview was typical of the problems associated with ‘lifers’<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (as he liked to refer to his more ‘experienced’ staff). He admitted that she was a #4 for ‘relational’. She put 59 at ease straight away -- as simple as a warm smile, the offer of a hot drink and a firm but welcoming handshake (despite, he noted disapprovingly, the latest health and safety memo about avoiding the winter vomiting bug). 
</p>
<p>
The issue was that, like most of her peers, her interviews often lacked appropriate focus and purpose. True to form, she had let 59 talk too much, wasting time, instead of cutting to the chase. Did she really need to know the ins and outs of his divorce or his worries about how the court case would affect his struggle to see his kids? Worse still, letting him bleat on about the injustices of his dismissal from his job just gave him time and space to repeat excuses for his offences instead of taking responsibility. If ever there was a moment for an ‘appropriate challenge’ of his ‘cognitive distortions’, that was it – and Pauline had either missed it or bottled it. At best a #2 for ‘structuring’.
</p>
<p>
The lifers were stuck in their ways; ironic, he thought, since they considered themselves the experts at supporting change, always stressing their hard-earned experience at the frontline. But what good was decades of experience of doing things badly – or, at best, inefficiently? He had done the courses and read the correctional research. Most low-moderate risk offenders need, at most, brief, focused, structured interventions with prompt onward referral to interventions and services that addressed any ‘criminogenic’ factors. It wasn’t rocket science… Nor was it social work, whatever the old-timers thought.
</p>
<p>
No, it was court-ordered supervision and its purpose was simple; reduced reoffending at reduced cost. 59 just needed to know what to do, what not to do, who to go and see, and who to keep away from. Cheerily telling 59 to keep out of trouble didn’t cut it. It was a #1 for authority then. The risk assessment score justified only the most minimal intervention – and it was blindingly obvious that, if anything, he needed a few sessions of anger management. For now, the tag<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> could take care of keeping him away from his ex-boss, his ex-wife and his ex-life.  
</p>
<p>
Norman re-opened the video file and checked the clock-counter. 37 minutes and 14 seconds. The contract allowed 1 hour of contact time per month for low-moderate cases. And, instead of referring him on, Pauline had promised to visit 59 at home in a few days. So, a #1 for ‘brokerage’ then. The home visit was another health and safety issue – and another waste of precious time. 
</p>
<p>
Norman totted up Pauline’s score. Nine out of a possible 20. He’d have to talk to her. This appraisal wasn’t going to end well. Norman needed 75% of his staff scoring 15 or better in these audits to trigger the results-related bonus payment. For that he needed fresher, younger, hungrier staff. Pragmatists not puritans. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
No wonder the furrow in his brow had become a trench. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
IV	We’re not here to build the community, we’re here to protect it
</p>
<p>
Pauline noticed too late that Norm had directed her to the seat furthest from the door of the meeting room, placing himself between her and the exit. A familiar ploy. There was going to be no escape until he was finished, unless she went over or through him...
</p>
<p>
‘Pauline’, he began, ‘you know how much I respect your skills and experience, right?’
</p>
<p>
She waited for the inevitable ‘But’.
</p>
<p>
‘But things have changed and you need to change with them’, he continued, passing her the print-out of her appraisal score.
</p>
<p>
‘This sort of performance just won’t do’.
</p>
<p>
She sighed.
</p>
<p>
‘Norm, tell me this: How am I supposed to help the guy if I don’t get to know him and what makes him tick. That takes time.’
</p>
<p>
‘That’s the problem right there, Pauline’.
</p>
<p>
Norm lent back in his seat and smiled his patronising, faux-patient smile, pausing for dramatic effect.
</p>
<p>
‘You’re still labouring under the illusion that your job is to <strong>help</strong> these people. It’s not. Let me put this in the simplest possible terms: Your job is to stop them from reoffending – at least until their good behaviour triggers our results-related payment. I know what you’re thinking but it’s not about profit for profit’s sake; I want to invest that revenue in getting better and better at protecting communities’.
</p>
<p>
She couldn’t resist: ‘What? You mean communities where people don’t have time for each other, don't know each other and don’t help each other?’
</p>
<p>
Norm’s face coloured a little, his fixed smile starting to look like a rictus grin, but he retained his composure:
</p>
<p>
‘Pauline, please. You know me better than that. I value community as much as the next individual, but we are not here to <strong>build</strong> the community, we are here to <strong>protect</strong> it.’
</p>
<p>
The slow-spoken bold-print was starting to make Pauline’s eyeballs itch.
</p>
<p>
‘And we need to do that as time-efficiently as possible. We need to reduce costs and maximise returns. We owe it to the taxpayers. They don’t want their money wasted on tea and sympathy. We’re here to control and challenge behaviour that threatens communities. And we’re here to make offenders pay back for their crimes. Yes, it’s great if we can also improve and develop them as people, but the thing is Pauline, there’s really no convincing evidence that ‘help’ is all that helpful… at least not in reducing offending.’
</p>
<p>
Pauline couldn’t believe that Norm was putting air-quotes around ‘help’.
</p>
<p>
Trying not to rise to the bait, she settled in for the duration. She determined to apply her apparently outmoded appreciative perspective to the significant challenge of understanding the genesis of Norm’s distorted worldview. The sad thing – the dangerous thing – was that he genuinely seemed to believe this shit.
</p>
<p>
V        Any chance of a refill?
</p>
<p>
Pauline wondered if she had earned the right to ask the next question, and then ploughed ahead:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
“Look Joe. Let me be honest with you. I can understand why you were so pissed off with your boss; he sounds like a total dick. And I can see that the red paint made a point about him bleeding you dry over the years. I’m not saying it was justified but I get it. But – to be blunt – pissing on the reception floor? What was that all about?”
</p>
<p>
“I know,” Joe replied, head in hands and eyes fixed on the bare floorboards below, “I’m totally mortified about that. I did send Tracey some flowers by way of apology. She’s the office cleaner. Lovely woman. I hate the thought of her having to mop that up”.  
</p>
<p>
Joe took a deep breath, lifted his head, looked Pauline in the eye and continued:
</p>
<p>
“Look, the simple fact was that I had drunk 5 or 6 pints winding myself up for the confrontation. Confrontation is just not my thing -- nor is beer, it turns out. But, in the heat of the moment, and finding myself with a bladder fit to burst, spraying piss around like Michael Douglas in that movie Wall St just seemed like a great way to mess with Steve’s massive ego. Needless to say, it didn’t look so clever on the CCTV the Police showed me – but then none of it did.”
</p>
<p>
Pauline smiled and shook her head: “Pretty moronic, eh? Any chance of a refill?”
</p>
<p>
While Joe re-boiled the kettle, Pauline studied their surroundings. Joe’s place was not, she imagined, a deliberate effort at Scandinavian minimalism taken to extremes; more likely, it revealed that lack of self-care that often accompanies depression. The living room in his one-bedroom apartment boasted only a large beanbag, an easy chair (bottom of the range Ikea) and a small coffee table. An old TV sat on the floor in the corner. The un-curtained window looked out over the courtyard of what was a converted 1920s fire station. A gated community, sealed off from the city life outside. She’d seen much worse places, but she couldn’t imagine Joe’s kids being keen on sleepovers, unless they shared their dad’s newfound ascetic tastes.
</p>
<p>
Joe placed a fresh cup of instant coffee in front of Pauline and resumed his place awkwardly on the beanbag, sitting cross-legged and trying not to feel like an errant child.
</p>
<p>
“Anyway”, Pauline continued, “enough about what happened. Let’s talk about now. And let’s talk about the future. We’ve got 17 months of this order to get through; and you have the tag<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and your 7-7 curfew for the next 5. I suppose there are really just two or three questions: How do we get you through this without any further bother, and what do you want out of it – what do you want your future to be?  
</p>
<p>
Joe felt blindsided by the last two questions. The future? What future? He hadn’t been able to think clearly since the wheels came off the cart. It wasn’t just that he wasn’t driving the cart, it was that he hadn’t stopped falling since his life crashed. There didn’t seem to be any solid ground from which to take a view, just a constant tumble of words and images. Was Pauline going to help him find some solid ground? 
</p>
<p>
“The first question is a lot easier to answer than the other two. I’m fine with the tag – I haven’t had much of a social life since the divorce. It turned out that most of the friendships that we had kept up since we married were my wife’s – sorry -- ex-wife’s. I have a couple of old pals, but we don’t see that much of each other; the odd football match or night in the pub – at least, before all this happened. I’m totally off the drink for now – and not missing it.  I have the TV and the radio.”
</p>
<p>
Joe took a sip of his tea, looked out the window and continued:
</p>
<p>
“To be honest, the days are harder than the nights. Work was such a habit that I can’t get used to the sheer emptiness of the days. I miss the action and the sense of purpose much more than the money – though my ex and the kids might take a different view about that. I am looking for work, but it’s not easy at my age. It’s also pretty tricky explaining to your potential future boss why you assaulted your former boss. On the two occasions when I have got as far as interviews, I’ve seen the colour drain from their faces at that point.”  
</p>
<p>
“Work isn’t the only possible kind of action and purpose, though, is it?”, Pauline interjected. 
</p>
<p>
“No, I guess not: I still want to be a proper dad, but it’s hard when that amounts to a trip to the movies and a KFC Family Bucket once a week.”
</p>
<p>
Pauline could feel herself sinking into Joe’s hopelessness. The emptiness and desolation of the flat wasn’t helping, nor was the sense of being locked in… but it was giving her the germ of an idea.
</p>
<p>
“Look Joe: You’re an experienced accountant with a hell of a lot of skills and resources. You’re not broke – you still have some redundancy money, even after paying for the office clean-up. You said it yourself: You need some action and some purpose. You need to break out of this cell.” A smile crept across her face, and Joe raised an eyebrow in trepidation or curiosity. “And I have an idea about how we might spring you…”   
</p>
<p>
VI	A strangely appealing assembly
</p>
<p>
Joe couldn’t quite get his head around this place or these people. In fact, he felt a bit dazed. Or maybe dazzled. The meeting room was bristling with energy. The people were like fireflies alight with friction; sparks looking for tinder. He wasn’t sure whether to be excited or just plain terrified. Probably both.
</p>
<p>
Pauline had introduced Joe to Petra the week before, describing her as the convenor of the ‘Conviction Collective’. Petra said the collective as “part self-help group, part social movement” (though Joe thought it sounded more like a 70s folk-rock super-group). The only membership qualifications, she said, were a criminal conviction and a personal conviction, born of experience, that the justice system needed to change. Most of the fireflies in the room had both kinds of conviction, but they welcomed a few ‘associates’ – community activists, social workers, students and academics – who could boast only the second sort.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, Joe was sold on neither self-help nor social movements (nor 70s folk-rock super-groups), but Petra wasn’t the sort of person to take ‘no’ for an answer, and their initial conversation had piqued his curiosity. When she told him her own story – and the story of the group’s genesis -- it made him realise that he had been so busy trying to cope with his own spectacular and self-propelled fall from grace, that he hadn’t stopped to think that there were other people in his situation, also subject to the vagaries of the ‘system’ in which he found himself entangled.
</p>
<p>
Petra had spoken so passionately and so practically about the obstacles put in the way of re-building a life during and after punishment, and how things could and should be done better, that – for the first time since the incident -- Joe felt the stirrings of interest in something beyond his personal troubles. 
</p>
<p>
So, he had agreed to come to the meeting… and now he wondered if he regretted it. He felt uncomfortable, uncertain and ill-at-ease. The incessant din of chatter and laughter was giving him a headache. It had been a while since he had been around so many people. They could certainly be described as a motley crew, but they were also a strangely appealing assembly of diverse characters, perhaps held together only by their shared convictions. A little like a church without religion, Joe thought, still figuring out its doctrine and its rituals; a fellowship connected by a common hope for change. 
</p>
<p>
Petra looked across at him and smiled encouragingly. Joe felt the same unnerving sensation that he often experienced with Pauline; they both made him feel as if his thoughts were appearing as subtitles on his forehead.
</p>
<p>
A little later, as they tidied up the room, Petra asked:
</p>
<p>
“So, what do you reckon, Joe? I know that it can be a bit of a brain-melt, but if this collective is going to achieve anything, we’re going to need a fund-raiser and a treasurer. You’ve got the skills and qualifications – and Pauline says you need a project if you’re ever going to get your head out of your arse. As someone once said, ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to his need’. What do you say? You up for it?”
</p>

VII-a	Administering shocks and sickness
</p>
<p>
[12 months later]
</p>
<p>
Joe heard two sounds as he woke: his own low moan and the insistent, monotonous electronic bell tolling from his ankle bracelet. He fumbled for the clock—it read 08.01 – he had 59 minutes to get to the probation office for his check-in. He knew that somewhere, somehow, some algorithm had determined that this was the moment to test his commitment, to strengthen his resolve, to keep him from temptation. At least that was how Norm had explained it, but Joe saw that the bracelet-bell was a call to worship, an invitation to obey. He pressed the button to acknowledge the signal and the bell stopped.
</p>
<p>
Joe washed and dressed cautiously, taking care not to let his sock break the contact between bracelet and skin. He knew that any interruption in the signal that allowed remote biometric analysis of his pulse and sweat could constitute an infraction. He had no wish to repeat his recent experience of a weekend in the compliance cells as part of the new SaCS (Swift and Certain Sanction) approach. That had been a high price to pay for trying to use ice cubes and hypoallergenic wipes to relieve the skin irritation that the bracelet caused. 
</p>
<p>
Forty minutes later, Joe was glad to find a reporting booth empty at the probation office. It looked like a cross between an arcade game, a confessional and an upright coffin. He took a deep breath and sat inside, pulling the black curtain across. The touchscreen invited him to provide his hand-print while the retinal scan double checked and confirmed his identity. When prompted, Joe put on the virtual reality headset and was met by the smiling face of ‘Virpro’, the virtual probation officer. She spoke in slow, soft, maternal tones: 
</p>
<p>
“Good morning, Joe. Well done. You have arrived on time and drug- and alcohol-free. We have no record of adverse contact with the authorities since your last appointment. There are 4 months and 2 weeks of your revised order remaining to be served. The conditions remain the same. Would you like me to remind you of them?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you”, Joe replied. 
</p>
<p>
“That is your choice. Do you require any support or counselling at this time?”
</p>
<p>
“No, thank you”, Joe replied. He guessed he should probably show willing but couldn’t get out of the booth quickly enough. He already felt suffocated.
</p>
<p>
“That is your choice. Please wait for a message from future Joe, after which you are free to go.” 
</p>
<p>
This part always freaked Joe out. Virpro smiled her farewell and faded from view; in her place came an avatar of Joe, looking a few years older but well-groomed, confident, contented, suited and booted. His ‘brief motivational intervention’ was becoming as predictable as it was sinister:
</p>
<p>
“Hi Joe. I’m proud of you. You’ve done so well since that last infraction. The Swift and Certain Sanction really seems to have worked for you. You’re back on track, pal. And there are only a few months to go until you are a free man. Just keep at it. Keep your head down. Keep away from troublemakers”. 
</p>
<p>
Future Joe paused for effect, losing his saccharine smile and replacing it with the furrowed brow of his most earnest expression. Though his intense stare met Joe’s eyes, it also seemed to look right through him, somewhere into the middle distance. 
</p>
<p>
“Joe: Remember, you can become me, if you want it enough, if you really commit. I can be your future. Meantime, take care and look after us both”. 
</p>
<p>
Outside, Joe steadied himself on the railing, taking in as much air as he could. As he walked away, he wondered what Pauline was doing now. He hadn’t expected to miss her this much.
</p>
<p>
…
</p>
<p>
Upstairs, Norm looked at the three huge screens in front of him: 59’s green flag caught his eye. One of Pauline’s cases, he recalled. He had to admit that he kind of missed the lifers. The office was quiet without them. 
</p>
<p>
Still, Norm took some pride in that fact that he was now managing 412 low-medium risk cases himself; or rather, he was maintaining and monitoring the system that was managing them. It was remarkably efficient now that it was up and running, even if it would take 25 years (with caseloads at current levels) to recoup the installation costs. In the long run, it was worth it. Now that the infrastructure existed, the possibilities of combining remote biometric monitoring with VR and AI were limitless. 
</p>
<p>
That said, Norm still harboured doubts. The newly proposed GATE (Geo-Aversion Tag Enhancer) tech troubled him. These tags could respond to remote signals by releasing nausea-inducing drugs implanted in pellets under the offender’s skin. In an emergency, they could issue taser-style shocks. Both measures disabled offenders who strayed beyond their permitted spaces, or showed the classic signs of over-stimulation associated with imminent risk of offending. 
</p>
<p>
Norm had a lot of sympathy for the argument that GATE allowed high risk offenders to be managed safely in the community. As the marketing slogan put it, ‘GATE retrains and restrains’. The pilot studies seemed promising, despite one or two admittedly very unfortunate cases. Yet, even though the offenders would have to consent to GATE and even though they signed the relevant disclaimers, he didn’t much like the idea that he would be the one administering shocks and causing sickness, or even administering a system that did so. He tried to reassure himself that GATE wasn’t about punishment; it was just doing what was necessary for public safety. And <strong>he</strong> wasn’t being asked to press those buttons yet.
</p>
<p>
Norm thought it was probably best to keep his doubts to himself.

VII-b	Rehabilitating Norm(s)
</p>
<p>
[12 months later]
</p>
<p>
Norm heard two sounds as he woke: his own low moan and the insistent, monotonous electronic bell tolling from his alarm clock. It read 08.01 – he had 59 minutes to get ready and catch that train. Today was the day of the Justice Committee hearing on the future of supervision.
</p>
<p>
Norm hadn’t slept well, though already he couldn’t quite recollect the plots and sub-plots of the anxiety dreams that had plagued him in the night. Did Joe bring a tin of red paint to the hearing in one version? Did Petra accuse the parliamentarians of ‘techno-fascism’ in another? He was pretty sure Pauline had been late in every scenario his unconscious had so kindly visualised for him.
</p>
<p>
The old Norm would have run for cover long before now but, despite his fears, the new Norm was excited about the day ahead. There was no doubt that the past 12 months had changed him. As he looked in the mirror, tying his tie, he admitted that he liked what he was becoming better than what he had been. 
</p>
<p>
His first encounter with the Conviction Collective – at Pauline’s insistence – had left him unconvinced. Initially, he was sceptical about the willingness and ability of people under supervision to provide meaningful and effective peer support. But he reasoned that if the Collective was a free supplement to formal services, then why not give it a chance? To offset any risk to his personal reputation and standing in the Company, Norm made clear that it was Pauline’s initiative and Pauline’s responsibility. 
</p>
<p>
Within weeks though, seeing the glint in her eye and the spring in her step, he decided he should attend the weekly gathering and see what was going on. At first the answer seemed to be: ‘Not much’. About 12-15 people met and shared some pizza (it was never clear who paid for it, but Norm suspected Pauline). They talked together, sometimes they walked together. Someone found an old table tennis table and they played. 
</p>
<p>
But, they also got organised. Ever the accountant, Joe had been instrumental in persuading them to identify, recognise and detail all the forms of ‘capital’ that they held. He made an inventory of their skills, resources and contacts. They started to exchange goods, services and introductions for one another -- from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs. The group grew and so did the inventory. The founding members invested more of themselves, the new members brought new assets and abilities. In sum, they advised, assisted and befriended one another.
</p>
<p>
Group members also began to share more and more of their experiences – both good and bad – of the justice system. They invited other ‘expert witnesses’ to plug the gaps in their understanding; criminologists, lawyers, sociologists – even a historian. Norm himself had been invited to explain the logic of the current supervision system. That had been quite a challenge and quite a grilling. Soon, the Collective had written a manifesto, naming it: ‘Just Conviction, Fair Supervision’. Norm didn’t agree with all its prescriptions, but he admired its clarity, its use of evidence and the force of its arguments. 
</p>
<p>
The press soon took an interest. Petra turned out to be quite an operator; proving more than adept at handling everything from hostile questions from cynical political hacks to irate callers on early morning phone-ins. Surprisingly perhaps, listening to Petra and the others, people seemed to become more cautious and more curious about what court sentences did to people and about what they achieved or failed to achieve for society. 
</p>
<p>
Initially, Norm’s bosses had liked the positive PR that came with supporting the Collective; they thought it made them look progressive. They hadn’t been so happy about ‘Just Conviction, Fair Supervision’ – worried about their market share, he supposed, if those proposals were ever to be implemented. That said, Norm and Joe didn’t have to work too hard to convince the Company that excessive supervision wasn’t especially lucrative; not at least while there were stubbornly high revocation and reconviction rates. 
</p>
<p>
The Company also knew that re-nationalisation was back on the political agenda; it was time to look for better business opportunities elsewhere. At the very least, Joe had argued, working with the government and the courts to scale down supervision and to deliver better results might minimise losses in the meantime. And in reputational terms, it also meant that the Company wasn’t left carrying the can on its own.
</p>
<p>
It was now Norm’s job to lead the Ministry-sanctioned local pilot of ‘Just Conviction, Fair Supervision’. And the very early results of the pilot had led to the invitation to Norm, Petra, Pauline and Joe to give evidence to the Committee today.
</p>
<p>
The gang of four met at the coffee stall in the train station. Even Pauline was on time. They greeted one another as old friends, collected their orders and, as was their habit, made for the front carriage. They knew they were going to be in a hurry when they arrived in the capital. They had already come a long way together in a short time, but there was a lot of work still to be done.
