					<description><![CDATA[Thoughtful piece. The insurmountable difficulty for me is the idea of a self-policing supervision body which does not make paternalistic decisions.

Viewing supervisees as equals would be unthinkable to most practitioners, but that, at least in my humble opinion, is what is needed. 

Ps. Look forward to the book]]></description>
