					<description><![CDATA[Good point Tracey. I haven&#039;t really settled this in my head, but I think I have the very near future in mind, in a system which is privatised.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m curious as to where your story is set. It sounds like England given the &#039;probation&#039;  and assessment type mentioned when in Scotland we use the LSCMI risk assessment. I thought you were basing it in Scotland?
The description of him coming in early, work load, lack of time or enthusiasm to work out the offender all very  much on the button. 
I think the pressure felt by a lot of cjsw is the possible backlash from the judges on reading the report rather than the public. CJ supervision is very much a tick box exercise and risk management rather than welfare approach due to increased workload and less sw staff to do the work. 
Very much as you mention, time spent seeing a client is based on level of risk rather than need. 
The offence is certainly unusual from my perspective and not as convincing or believable as a reader. Majority of cases dealt with have been due to alcohol/ drugs/violence.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting thoughts. In NZ caseloads are definitely not as high as some of my colleagues in other jurisdictions describe, however, workload will always depend on the service level expectations. If caseloads are lower the service expectations will likely increase.

What I found interesting was the fear of reprisal should something go wrong with a case. I have reviewed a number of serious events, mostly murders committed by people on parole, and in recent times have not seen this occur here. Yet I know that a number of our staff worry about this.  I suspect this is caused by some of the public dialogue about such events which is where the cries of &quot;heads must roll&quot; tend to come from.  This seems to influence the feelings of staff more than the organisational response.

Following reviews I have occaisionally also met with the family of victims to discuss the findings. In these meetings victims have never wanted to level blame on the shoulders of frontline staff but prefer to understand what sort of organisational or system changes can be made.  

The question this leaves me with is, why do the views of the wider public often diverge from the views and feelings of actual victims? And to what extent does this influence the decisions of frontline staff?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a Couple of thoughts before I head to a Drug Court staffing.....So the feeling is really there that if a Client makes a bad decision, it falls on the shoulders of the Probation Officer?   That&#039;s a good way to scare off, or burn out, good employees.  

50-60 would be on the low end of spectrum of cases in the US; or at least in Tulsa, OK.  60-100 is probably the range...but 60 is probably fair for everybody, depending on how many people are assisting with the case.  The Drug Court system is so helpful because you have a Coordinator, Therapist, Supervision Officer, and maybe even a separate Case Manager.  The more members you have on the Team, the more support the Client is going to have.  How many roles is the Probation Officer actually fulfilling, would be a good question.]]></description>
