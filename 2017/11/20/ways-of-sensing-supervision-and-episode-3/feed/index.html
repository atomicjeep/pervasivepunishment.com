					<description><![CDATA[37 minutes 14 seconds! 59 is lucky, I think. I know a Lifer whose next appointment is written on his appointment card before his bottom reaches the seat of the  interview room chair. The same scenario each &#038; every probation appointment. Rehabilitation? Risk Assessment? Need and responsivity? No to all of these. Just ticking a box. Groundhog Day, bench after bench after bench.  They know absolutely. O thing about this Lifer apart from his offence 20 years previously. 
Great podcast!]]></description>
