					<description><![CDATA[As I was reading I thought back to my time as a volunteer manager, and had the same idea as Kirstin - that lots of small organisations struggle to keep their books, produce accounts, budget for funding bids, and so on. It&#039;s pretty common to have a glut of volunteers for some roles, and a dearth for others. It&#039;s also common that if someone comes along with particular skills, you can suddenly notice a role for them which wasn&#039;t obvious before - though it can be hard to integrate them quickly. I am sure there would be local organisations which could find a space for Joe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fergus, the section on Pauline&#039;s appraisal is disheartening and just plain wrong. It&#039;s good to see other &#039;characters&#039; in this scenario as we often do focus on the person who has offended. What&#039;s to happen to Joe? Pauline could connect him to a third sector organisation that needs his skills and allows him to find some friends in the process. 
By the way, I think this medium is a great way to illuminate the intricacies of the processes and relationships that take place in criminal justice scenarios in a way that traditional academic writing can leave out. Looking forward to reading the next installation!]]></description>
