					<description><![CDATA[Hi Fergus,

What about relational aspect of supervision? Co-creating space and therapeutic dimension in this human contact? How supervisor&#039;s presence in the here and now with the offender shape and colour the atmosphere of supervision?  It is offender supervision, it is in criminal justice system space but it is still a contact between two human beings isn&#039;t it?

Best wishes,
Jelena]]></description>
