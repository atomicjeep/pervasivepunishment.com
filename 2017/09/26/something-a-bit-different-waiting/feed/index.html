					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Ben. I am mining lots of different supervision studies -- particularly the pilot projects in the COST Action on Offender Supervision in Europe -- and some of my own experiences. I guess the &#039;new&#039; thing -- for me at least -- is representing these findings in a fictionalised form. I know there is much debate about the lines between fact and fiction in ethnographic work... especially where there are ethical reasons for changing the &#039;facts&#039; to protect confidentiality. Anyway, much to ponder...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a very interesting idea, Fergus. There are, of course, examples of work within the field that draw on memoirs and first-hand accounts. Goffman&#039;s Asylums does this beautifully (although he uses a large number of texts, rather than individual &#039;characters&#039;). Would there be a body of literature on supervision in the community that you could mine in a similar way? Another option, which I have tried to some degree, is to provide the life stories of key research participants and then weave them and their experiences through the text. Again, you might not have the data to be able to do this, but it seems something worth considering. Ben]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Fergus, 
I really like the approach you are taking, for all the reasons you give above. On top of that, I think the approach you propose implicitly (or maybe explicitly?) critiques the hierarchies of types of knowledge that we often take for granted in academic writing and beyond that in the way we design services and practices. I also think that it goes really well with your ideas about reintegration being a two-way street and in a way your approach would put that ontology into practice in the very act of conceptualising and writing the book. I am sorry if my comment seems obvious. I think its great that we can follow your thinking process on this blog, fascinating! Best wishes,Katharina]]></description>
