					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff! I will be watching with interest as always with your work, Fergus. I have been trying to get back into NSW prisons with no luck as a sole ECR ( but old and experienced practitioner). My book &quot;The Lived Sentence&quot; is about the continuous nature of sentencing and the effect of the managerialist ethos on the achievement of the aims of sentencing , particularly rehabilitation. Little appetite for this kind of research here - they want administrative criminology, so I am so pleased to see your focus on people&#039;s lived experience.]]></description>
